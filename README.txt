Romanian UD treebank

*UPDATE* August 19th, 2016 (to be removed for the next release): ro-ud-*.conllu is the same file which is the whole Romanian TB. We want to spot and resolve all content validation errors.

The Romanian UD treebank (called RoRefTrees) is based on RACAI-RoTb (Irimia and Barbu Mititelu, 2015) and on UAIC-RoTb (Perez, 2014). In the latter, the texts were selected in order to have all syntactic functions represented in the treebank: the 35 relations used to annotate the 5800 sentences occur, altogether, 41210 times. The percent of each relation representation in the treebank vary from 14.48% (the most frequent, namely the complement of a preposition) to 0.02% (the least frequent, namely the adjunct expressing exception). RACAI-RoTb presents the advantage of having been created on the basis of a balanced corpus (Ion et al., 2012), from which 5000 sentences were selected so as to belong to all domains represented in the corpus, to respect frequency criteria for verbs, as well as to have various lengths. As a consequence, the texts in RoRefTrees belong to various styles (journalistic, belletristic, law, science) and are rather balanced (statistics will be offered in the final form of the paper). Thus, we can say that the resulted treebank features all possible syntactic relations for Romanian.

For the second release of Romanian UD trees, the team of the SSPR project (Verginica Mititelu, Elena Irimia, Cenel-Augusto Perez, Radu Ion and Radu Simionescu) continued the human-supervised, automatic mapping of the two original treebanks (RACAI-RoTb and UAIC-RoTb) to the UD annotation style by first doing an automatic mapping from the original label set to the UD label set, followed by a manual (word by word) inspection of the machine-assigned UD labels.

DATA SPLITS

We split the treebank as follows: the test set (ro-ud-test.conllu) is 12.5% of the whole treebank, the development set (ro-ud-dev.conllu) also 12.5%, while the rest of the treebank (75%) is the training set (ro-ud-train.conllu). The data was split in a random fashion.
